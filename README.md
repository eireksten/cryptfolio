# Crypto Portfolio

Program to track and display your cryptocurrency portfolio.

This is a work in progress, so the features are VERY limited atm.

## Building and running the app

You need to have Node.js and NPM install to build and run this app. To build, run these commands from the base directory:

- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```npm run build```

To start the app, run ```npm start``` from the base directory.

## Usage

The app currently has two commands, ```display``` and ```exit```. The first one displays data for your portfolio, while the second one exits the program.

To actually set what you have in your portfolio, you have to modify the amount values in ```src/commands.js``` and run ```npm run build``` before restarting the program.
